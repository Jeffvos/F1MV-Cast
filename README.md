# F1MV-Cast

This React app provides a simple platform for casting basic Formula 1 race information during live or ondemand sessions, playing on F1 MultiViewer.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `why?!`

Watching F1 on F1 MultiViewer is amazing, but I couldn't find a way to create a simple information panel to be able to cast to a google chromecast or google tv. With this project you are able to cast the tab displaying race info.
